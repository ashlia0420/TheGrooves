              <h3 class="fs-1">Our Story</h3>
            <p>It all began with two friends who shared a deep passion for dance and a dream of creating something bigger together.
                Their countless conversations about rhythm, movement, and teamwork soon inspired them to form a dance crew. With the
                full support of the institute, they organized auditions to find students who shared their enthusiasm and talent.
                From this, <strong>The Grooves</strong> was born — a collective united by dedication and love for the art of dance.
            </p>
            <p>Starting small but driven by steady growth, the crew began performing at college-level events, gradually building
                their reputation for skill and creativity. Over time, the team has expanded to over 20 talented members, each
                bringing their unique energy and style.</p>
            <p>Today, The Grooves stands as a vibrant and dynamic dance family, led by its two founders and guided by experienced
                mentorship. Together, they continue to inspire, innovate, and push the boundaries of campus dance culture.</p>
